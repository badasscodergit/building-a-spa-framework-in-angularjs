Code for my Pluralsight course:  <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-spa-framework-angularjs">Building a SPA Framework Using AngularJS</a>

Here's the "after" source code for Module 7, Video 8 of my course <em>Building a SPA Framework Using AngularJS</em>.  Please note this
is the project before the course goes into using Gulp.  I did this to avoid confusion, since many people won't be using Gulp and
might get confused by the generated files.

Also note I'm using stub images, since the images are only licensed for video use.  The images are all the same sizes as in 
the video course.
